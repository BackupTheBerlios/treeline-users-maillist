<PRE>I built treeline 1.0.2 using PyQt 3.17.4, Qt 3.3.8, SIP 4.7.4 and both  
python 2.5 and 2.4. The build process goes smoothly, but when I launch  
treeline, it opens with no fonts -- either in the interface or the  
documents. I can edit .treeline, where the font slots are simply  
empty, to get documents I can read, but there are no legible menu  
commands. All the menus open and are active (except the font selection  
submenu), but I obviously can't use the app in this state.

Any suggestions?

I am using Mac OS X 10.5.2, but I'm using the non framework versions  
of python (standard unix releases) provided by fink. And more or less  
standard x11 everything else.

I have had success building and running treeline 1.1.10 using PyQt4  
and Qt4, but I'm trying to maintain some backwards compatibility while  
I work through some upgrade questions with PyQt. The immediate goal is  
to not have to maintain two versions of SIP.

In case you're wondering, fink has version 1.0.2 of treeline working  
as built against PyQt 3.15, Qt 3.3.8, and SIP 4.3.1. So I'm dealing  
with several versions of cruft in dependencies.
