<PRE>Hi,

The TreeLine project is alive again!  There is finally a new development
release.  Sorry about the delay, but the period when I was too busy to
work on TreeLine should be over.

The largest change was improving HTML directory export.  There were also
several minor updates and bug fixes.

I'm also releasing the French GUI translation.  It is the only language
with a complete translation for the GUI (so far).  I've also just
finished modifying the ReadMe documentation, so the documentation
translation updates can start soon.

The translators tend to be busy with other projects, so any additional
volunteers to help with translations are welcome.

This development version is nearly ready for stable release.  The only
missing feature is translations, and it doesn't seem to have any major
bugs.  It should be suitable for most purposes.

This release can be downloaded from
&lt;<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable</A>&gt;.

Note that the mailing list address has changed.  New messages can be
sent to &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/treeline-users">treeline-users at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt;.  To view or change

Thanks for testing!


More details are in the changelog:

Notes:

  - This is an unstable development snapshot. It is nearly ready to
    become a stable release, but it could still contain bugs. Testing
    and bug reports are appreciated.

  - The French translation of the GUI is the only one completed so far.
    None of the documentation translations have been updated.

  - On Linux, running TreeLine requires Qt version 4.1 or higher and
    PyQt version 4.0 or higher. Binary packages may not be available yet
    for these libraries in some distributions.

  - If you've installed previous development releases, it is recommended
    that you delete the old configuration file
    (&quot;~/.treeline-1.1/treelinerc&quot; on Linux, &quot;Documents and
    Settings\&lt;login&gt;\Application Data\bellz\treeline-1.1 \treeline.ini&quot;
    on Windows) before running this release.

Updates:

  - Exporting to HTML directories has been improved. The file names are
    generated from the reference field (were from the first field).
    Internal links to nodes now work properly in the exported files.

  - When saving a new file, the Save-As dialog now defaults to the top
    directory in the recent file list.

  - A translation of the GUI in French is now available. The i18n
    installation file is a separate download.

  - The ReadMe documentation file has been updated to clarify certain
    usage issues.

Bug Fixes:

  - The other controls in the configuration dialog are updated
    immediately when setting a data type to be derived from a generic.

  - A recent file list bug that affected the httpload plugin has been
    fixed. Also, a library need by the plugin (urllib) has been added to
    the Windows installation.

  - An error message about removing a status bar widget has been
    eliminated.

  - An error on a Mac when setting the language encoding has been fixed.

  - Various issues with file paths containing Unicode characters have
    been fixed.
