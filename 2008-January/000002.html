</I>
That is &quot;intended functionality&quot;  ;)

When numbering for the first time, the user should enter a new field
name as the &quot;Number Field&quot;.  If the name of an existing field is given,
the content of that field is overwritten with the numbers.

If you want the number shown before each title, you should give a new
field name (such as &quot;Num&quot;) for the numbering, then change the Title or
Output format to &quot;{*Num*} {*Name*}&quot;.

I've thought about allowing numbers to be prepended to an existing field
with existing data, but it causes problems when re-numbering.  The
program could replace number-like text at the beginning of the field
data, but that wouldn't always work, since numbering formats can vary
significantly, and the results would be bad with any field text that
originally started with a number (&quot;2 dozen eggs&quot;).

&gt;<i> When creating a new Field type from the Configure Data Types &gt;&gt; Field List
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; New Field dialog, if I enter illegal characters I get an error message
</I>&gt;<i> that reads &quot;The following characters are not allowed:&quot;   However, the list
</I>&gt;<i> of disallowed characters is missing from the error message.
</I>
Was the offending character a space?  Other illegal characters seem to
show up OK for me.  Actually, the space is showing up, too - you just
can't see it  ;)

I'll add quotes to the error message, so that a space will show as &quot; &quot;.

&gt;<i> Another potentially troublesome issue. The length of text in Basic Longtext
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be limited to 200 lines. I often need to clip very long content
</I>&gt;<i> from other sources when doing research so I have a complete record of source
</I>&gt;<i> materials that I reference in papers I write. Is that a trait of the Basic
</I>&gt;<i> Longtext template that I can work around by creating my own template or is
</I>&gt;<i> that a coded barrier in Treeline itself? I found a relevant setting yet when
</I>&gt;<i> working from the default template.
</I>
The number of lines option is only used for setting the height of the
text edit box in the Data Editor view.  If an entry is longer than the
setting, scroll bars will appear on the text edit box.  The maximum of
200 lines for the editor height is reasonable (if not annoyingly high).

&gt;<i> I haven't tried it yet, but wonder whether the latter issue might also raise
</I>&gt;<i> issues when opening a lengthy document in a supported file format such as
</I>&gt;<i> ODT. How does Treeline handle attempts to open an ODT file if a continuous
</I>&gt;<i> block of text without headings is longer than 200 lines? I.e., does
</I>&gt;<i> Treeline  generate an error message or truncate text without warning?
</I>
I just tested it with 3000 lines of text - it works fine.

&gt;<i> Again, Treeline is looking very cool. Nice work!
</I>
Thanks!
Doug.
