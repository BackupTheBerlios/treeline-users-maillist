Ah. Makes sense. You might consider adding an &quot;Are You Sure&quot; message warning
that applying numbering to existing node titles will eat the existing
titles, with options to cancel, to continue, and &quot;don't show me this message
again.&quot; Such a message might be omitted if there is only a root node with
the default &quot;main&quot; title, and no children.

</I>&gt;<i> Was the offending character a space?  Other illegal characters seem to
</I>&gt;<i> show up OK for me.  Actually, the space is showing up, too - you just
</I>&gt;<i> can't see it  ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I had a space in the text that drew the error message. But I'm not seeing
any other of the illegal characters so don't know what they are. It's
conceivable I might have had more than one illegal character.

It's curious that you are seeing the illegal characters but I am not. I've
got about 36 hours left to finish a major report then will do some
experimenting with system settings. I've hit one program (WordPerfect X3)
that truncates a dialog with the WinXP system font size set to higher than
117 per cent, which is where I have it set now. (It's a known issue.)
Something similar might be the culprit.

The number of lines option is only used for setting the height of the
&gt;<i> text edit box in the Data Editor view.  If an entry is longer than the
</I>&gt;<i> setting, scroll bars will appear on the text edit box.  The maximum of
</I>&gt;<i> 200 lines for the editor height is reasonable (if not annoyingly high).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I just tested it with 3000 lines of text - it works fine.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah. I misunderstood. I thought it was a limit on the number of lines in the
node text.

I really like the new UI, much more intuitive.

Best regards,

Marbux
