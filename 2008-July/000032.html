Yes, you can have multiple page output, but a single table can't span
multiple pages.

</I>
Yes.  TreeLine's HTML engine isn't smart enough to insert page breaks
inside tables.  It tries to keep tables together, but that causes
problems when a single table is larger than a full page.  I might be
able to fix this in the future, but it won't be anytime soon.

There are some possible work-arounds, but none that give you quite
what you want:

  - Export the file to HTML, then use a web browser to print it.

  - Make each node its own table by replacing the Sibling Prefix/Suffix
    tags with tags in the node output.  Unfortunately, this will cause
    the columns to be misaligned.

  - Create a spacer node type to act as a page break.  It should just
    have a non-breaking space character (&nbsp;) as its only output.
    Because they don't have Sibling Prefix/Suffix tags, these spacer
    nodes would interrupt the big table, allowing TreeLine to break the
    page at those locations.  But finding the right places for these
    nodes would be guess-work.

  - Replace the table with an output scheme that just uses text.

Sorry that I don't have better options.

&gt;<i> Once a large amount of data is accumulated in a *.trl, is there a way of
</I>&gt;<i> extracting just the data with &quot;relationships&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to audit my results and therefore want to run queries against data

</I>&gt;<i> and Number of Patients with &quot;Total Hip Replacement&quot; as a child type where
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Infection&quot; is listed in the complications field.
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see I really need to be able to export just the data as a set of

</I>&gt;<i> don't have the expertise to walk the xml for myself - sorry.
</I>
I can't think of a way to do this.  TreeLine can export to a
tab-delimited text file, but only with a single level of data (the
children of the selected node, not the grandchildren).  The closest you
could come would be to use either the &quot;Flatten by Category&quot; command or
to add child reference fields prior to export, but neither looks like a
good option in this case.

Doug.
