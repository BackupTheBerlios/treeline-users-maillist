<PRE>To: Steve B

Thanks for the suggestion.  I just picked a random recovery utility (I 
tried Undelete Plus).
Ideally I would have removed the drive and put it in another machine to 
run the recover program but
it's a Sony UX180 that I didn't dare open.  By the time I let the PC sit 
for a couple of days not sure what to do then mounted a remote drive,  
then mounted a USB drive with Undelete Plus on it I only had random junk 
in the restored files.

Hopefully the Auto Save will work for you in the future.  I've been 
saved by it countless times.  I'll go weeks without exiting Treeline.  I 
do try to remember to do a Treeline File-&gt;Save before suspending but 
obviously I don't always remember to!

Being able to sync to something like a  Subversion Server with revision 
control is a dream of mine.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that if you create a empty .trl~ file named the same as your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .trl file, when Treeline starts it will do the normal thing of asking if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want to restore your backup.  Of course you say yes because that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you always do (I'm running 1.0.2 and another bug gets me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occasionally).  Treeline instantly deletes the original (good but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slightly old) file and then asks what to do with the empty file.  No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matter what you answer you are left with a empty Tree.  How can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like this happen in real life you ask?  I've had windows hang
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while suspending and I've had to power off the machine.  If a Treeline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file is open I've ended up with a .trl~ file that was full of nulls (the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same size as the .trl~ file would normally be).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps something to consider would be to simply not delete the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> .trl file.   If the Treeline file needs to be rewritten for Treeline to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue working then it should only be deleted after a Well Formed and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Valid XML file is read in.  Treeline should probably only accept .trl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files as backup.  I can't think of any reason to have the flexibility of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reading in any type of files as a .trl~ backup file but if there is, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> warning prompt could be given for non .trl~  format backup files.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There maybe something that can be done to make the writing of the .trl~
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backup file more robust  (I don't know anything about Windows File
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internals so I can't  be of any help there).  Perhaps the original file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be put in the Recycle Bin rather than just deleted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime I'd recommend users check their .trl~ files after a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crash with a text or better yet XML editor.  Don't assume just because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the backup file is the right size that it's a good backup file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This happens even in the latest Windows unstable 1.1.10 version.  I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running Windows XP.
