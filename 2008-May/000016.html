<PRE>Since there hasn't been any traffic to the mailing list in a long time, 
I thought I would post here rather than just submitting a bug report.

I first have to give a quick - I really appreciate Treeline and my life 
depends on it mention and thanks to Doug.
I have ~1390 items in my todo  list so you can imagine how  dependent I 
am on it.

Hopefully I can help others avoid the trauma I am going through today!

It seems that if you create a empty .trl~ file named the same as your 
.trl file, when Treeline starts it will do the normal thing of asking if 
you want to restore your backup.  Of course you say yes because that is 
what you always do (I'm running 1.0.2 and another bug gets me 
occasionally).  Treeline instantly deletes the original (good but 
slightly old) file and then asks what to do with the empty file.  No 
matter what you answer you are left with a empty Tree.  How can 
something like this happen in real life you ask?  I've had windows hang 
while suspending and I've had to power off the machine.  If a Treeline 
file is open I've ended up with a .trl~ file that was full of nulls (the 
same size as the .trl~ file would normally be).

Perhaps something to consider would be to simply not delete the original 
.trl file.   If the Treeline file needs to be rewritten for Treeline to 
continue working then it should only be deleted after a Well Formed and 
Valid XML file is read in.  Treeline should probably only accept .trl 
files as backup.  I can't think of any reason to have the flexibility of 
reading in any type of files as a .trl~ backup file but if there is, a 
warning prompt could be given for non .trl~  format backup files. 
There maybe something that can be done to make the writing of the .trl~ 
backup file more robust  (I don't know anything about Windows File 
Internals so I can't  be of any help there).  Perhaps the original file 
could be put in the Recycle Bin rather than just deleted.

In the meantime I'd recommend users check their .trl~ files after a 
crash with a text or better yet XML editor.  Don't assume just because 
the backup file is the right size that it's a good backup file.

This happens even in the latest Windows unstable 1.1.10 version.  I'm 
running Windows XP.


John
