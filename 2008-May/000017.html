This is a good place for it.  It lets other users know about the issue.

&gt;<i> I first have to give a quick - I really appreciate Treeline and my

</I>&gt;<i> my todo  list so you can imagine how  dependent I am on it.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems that if you create a empty .trl~ file named the same as your
</I>&gt;<i> .trl file, when Treeline starts it will do the normal thing of asking
</I>&gt;<i> if you want to restore your backup.  Of course you say yes because
</I>&gt;<i> that is what you always do (I'm running 1.0.2 and another bug gets me
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally).  Treeline instantly deletes the original (good but
</I>&gt;<i> slightly old) file and then asks what to do with the empty file.  No
</I>&gt;<i> matter what you answer you are left with a empty Tree.  How can
</I>&gt;<i> something like this happen in real life you ask?  I've had windows
</I>&gt;<i> hang while suspending and I've had to power off the machine.  If a
</I>&gt;<i> Treeline file is open I've ended up with a .trl~ file that was full of
</I>&gt;<i> nulls (the same size as the .trl~ file would normally be).
</I>
I can't reproduce the problem that lead to a backup file full of nulls.
Maybe the file system was trying to write it precisely when the PC died.

&gt;<i> Perhaps something to consider would be to simply not delete the
</I>&gt;<i> original .trl file.   If the Treeline file needs to be rewritten for
</I>&gt;<i> Treeline to continue working then it should only be deleted after a
</I>&gt;<i> Well Formed and Valid XML file is read in.  Treeline should probably
</I>&gt;<i> only accept .trl files as backup.  I can't think of any reason to have
</I>&gt;<i> the flexibility of reading in any type of files as a .trl~ backup file
</I>&gt;<i> but if there is, a warning prompt could be given for non .trl~  format
</I>&gt;<i> backup files.  There maybe something that can be done to make the
</I>&gt;<i> writing of the .trl~ backup file more robust  (I don't know anything
</I>&gt;<i> about Windows File Internals so I can't  be of any help there).
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the original file could be put in the Recycle Bin rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just deleted.
</I>
I'll look at making a change.  At the very least it should make sure a
valid TreeLine backup file is read before replacing the original file.

Doug.
