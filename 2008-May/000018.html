<PRE> Go to the Web, find one of the excellent file recovery utilities (one that
is recommended, but that I've not used is called &quot;Recuva,&quot; spelled just like
that), and *recover* your old file.  You will need to *rename* your new file
before you do this.

</I>&gt;<i> I have ~1390 items in my todo  list so you can imagine how  dependent I

</I>&gt;<i> It seems that if you create a empty .trl~ file named the same as your
</I>&gt;<i> .trl file, when Treeline starts it will do the normal thing of asking if
</I>&gt;<i> you want to restore your backup.  Of course you say yes because that is
</I>&gt;<i> what you always do (I'm running 1.0.2 and another bug gets me
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally).  Treeline instantly deletes the original (good but
</I>&gt;<i> slightly old) file and then asks what to do with the empty file.  No
</I>&gt;<i> matter what you answer you are left with a empty Tree.  How can
</I>&gt;<i> something like this happen in real life you ask?  I've had windows hang
</I>&gt;<i> while suspending and I've had to power off the machine.  If a Treeline
</I>&gt;<i> file is open I've ended up with a .trl~ file that was full of nulls (the
</I>&gt;<i> same size as the .trl~ file would normally be).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps something to consider would be to simply not delete the original
</I>&gt;<i> .trl file.   If the Treeline file needs to be rewritten for Treeline to
</I>&gt;<i> continue working then it should only be deleted after a Well Formed and
</I>&gt;<i> Valid XML file is read in.  Treeline should probably only accept .trl
</I>&gt;<i> files as backup.  I can't think of any reason to have the flexibility of
</I>&gt;<i> reading in any type of files as a .trl~ backup file but if there is, a
</I>&gt;<i> warning prompt could be given for non .trl~  format backup files.
</I>&gt;<i> There maybe something that can be done to make the writing of the .trl~
</I>&gt;<i> backup file more robust  (I don't know anything about Windows File
</I>&gt;<i> Internals so I can't  be of any help there).  Perhaps the original file
</I>&gt;<i> could be put in the Recycle Bin rather than just deleted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime I'd recommend users check their .trl~ files after a
</I>&gt;<i> crash with a text or better yet XML editor.  Don't assume just because
</I>&gt;<i> the backup file is the right size that it's a good backup file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This happens even in the latest Windows unstable 1.1.10 version.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> running Windows XP.
