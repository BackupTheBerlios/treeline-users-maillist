<PRE>
My name is Chuck Tilbury and I started using TreeLine a few weeks ago.  
I like it very much and I use it for several things:
* tracking my time (I am a embedded software engineer).
* tracking my personal and my professional TODO list.
* I write stories as a hobby and this is useful for that as well.

It is simple, configurable, stable, and it runs on all of the platforms 
that I use.  Great job Doug!  Thanks for sharing it!

I have a need for a feature that I think should be either really easy or 
totally impossible.  I would like to hear what everyone has to say.  
Perhaps someone has already thought of it or is working on a plugin.

The feature is that I would like to be able to see several lines for a 
bullet in the tree view.  It would like it be configurable as a part of 
the data type.  There would be an item added to the data type field 
config dialog that would allow one to specify how many lines (perhaps 
zero) of the field to display in the tree view.  Then, in the tree view, 
the line display would be truncated to fit in the space available.

I also noticed that when I create a new type, if I delete the name 
field, the only way to put it back in the type is to recreate the type.  
Is that a bug?  :)

Best Regards!
