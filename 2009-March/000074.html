Unfortunately, this request is much closer to &quot;impossible&quot; than &quot;easy&quot;.
It would be a major change to how the library's tree view displays
itself.

&gt;<i> I also noticed that when I create a new type, if I delete the name 
</I>&gt;<i> field, the only way to put it back in the type is to recreate the type.  
</I>&gt;<i> Is that a bug?  :)
</I>
I can't reproduce this problem.  For me, it adds back in just fine.  Can
you give more details about how this happens?  Do you get an error
message?

Doug.
