<PRE>Hi,

It's finally time for the first snapshot release in a new development
cycle.  This release adds multiple-window capabilities, easier inline
internal links, and a new HTML export option.

Please keep in mind that this snapshot is not complete and is probably
buggy.  It should not be used for any critical work.  Feedback is
apprecisted.

It can be downloaded from
&lt;<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable</A>&gt;.

I hope to keep this development cycle much shorter than the last one.  I
don't plan to include additional major changes until the next cycle.

More details are in the changelog:

Notes:

  - This is an unstable development snapshot. It is not feature complete
    and probably contains bugs. Testing and bug reports are appreciated,
    but the stable release (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical
    work.

  - The documentation has not yet been updated to cover the new
    features.

  - The GUI and documentation translations have not yet been updated.

New Features:

  - Multiple TreeLine windows with different files can be open within
    the same TreeLine session. The &quot;Open files in new windows&quot; general
    option controls whether new windows are used when opening or
    creating files.

  - A &quot;Window&quot; menu has been added with commands to create new windows,
    close windows, or select from a list of current windows.

  - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
    the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
    same document. This can be used to work in different sections of the
    file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the non-active window
    does not show the changes made in the active window until the
    non-active window is focused.

  - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
    line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
    running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
    specified by file association or in the command line.

  - An &quot;Add internal link&quot; context menu has been added to text boxes in
    the data editor. It prompts for another node to be clicked with the
    mouse, then an inline internal link is added with that node's
    reference information.

  - Added an &quot;HTML directory pages&quot; export option. This will export to a
    directory structure with an HTML file for every node. A navigation
    pane on the left side of each page contains links to the node's
    parent, uncles and children.

Updates:

  - The general options dialog has been split into three columns for
    better viewing on small, wide displays.

  - Additional export commands and export options have been added to the
    plugin interface.

  - To avoid a problem on the Mac platform, when TreeLine is run for the
    first time, it lets the OS determine the window position.


Thanks for testing!
Doug
