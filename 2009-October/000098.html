&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>
&gt;<i> It's finally time for the first snapshot release in a new development
</I>&gt;<i> cycle.  This release adds multiple-window capabilities, easier inline
</I>&gt;<i> internal links, and a new HTML export option.
</I>
Thank you - although I must say it's a very nice package as is!

&gt;<i> Please keep in mind that this snapshot is not complete and is probably
</I>&gt;<i> buggy.  It should not be used for any critical work.  Feedback is
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated.
</I>
Okay :)

&gt;<i> New Features:
</I>
&gt;<i>   - Multiple TreeLine windows with different files . . .
</I>Nice.

&gt;<i>   - A &quot;Window&quot; menu has been added . . .
</I>Of course.

&gt;<i>   - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
</I>&gt;<i>     the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
</I>&gt;<i>     same document. This can be used to work in different sections of the
</I>&gt;<i>     file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the non-active window
</I>&gt;<i>     does not show the changes made in the active window until the
</I>&gt;<i>     non-active window is focused.
</I>Can the &quot;not show changes&quot; behavior be an option? Or offer a &quot;re-calc&quot;
keystroke (like spread sheets)?

I can think of situations where seeing &quot;data output&quot; and &quot;data editor&quot; views
at the same time could be pretty handy when making simple text changes.

Some and/or all advanced references (in the &quot;{**field_name*}&quot; syntax family)
could be ignored for these situations until either the non-active window is
focused, or the &quot;re-calc&quot; keystroke is entered.

&gt;<i>   - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
</I>&gt;<i>     line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
</I>&gt;<i>     running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
</I>&gt;<i>     specified by file association or in the command line.
</I>Can this behavior be an option as well?

I run multiple copies of several programs, for example, Firefox. Right now I
have a FF window with news and stock portfolios, another on RV searches
(doing homework for an ebay auction), and a third on hosting providers
(changing providers soon I hope).  I often have three or four Tree Line
files open for the same reason, and sometimes have the same file open more
than once (yes, I know the risk) to eliminate &quot;tennis match neck&quot;.

In the &quot;good old days&quot; I'd have quite a few copies of simple text editors
and such running at the same time, each working with it's own file. Any
single mis-behaving program (or process) could be terminated with zero
impact on the others.

Some apps (like FF) try to fake this (much like you propose) but only have
one executable. I can appreciate this because of cache issues and so forth,
but I don't see the need with Tree Line. FF can get &quot;stuck&quot; from time to
time, and sometimes closing one window will work. Sometimes it doesn't :)

Old habits die hard :) And I really hate &quot;single window&quot; programs like
Quicken that actively prevent multiple views into the same data.

&gt;<i>   - An &quot;Add internal link&quot; context menu has been added . . .
</I>That could be handy.

&gt;<i>   - Added an &quot;HTML directory pages&quot; export option. This . . .
</I>Interesting. Not sure how I'd use it, but . . .

&gt;<i> Updates:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - The general options dialog has been split into three columns for
</I>&gt;<i>     better viewing on small, wide displays.
</I>Great. Treeline is a bear on a little Linux netbook :)

&gt;<i> Thanks for testing!
</I>Can't promise I will, but thanks for your continued interest!
