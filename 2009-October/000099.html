</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's finally time for the first snapshot release in a new development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycle.  This release adds multiple-window capabilities, easier inline
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal links, and a new HTML export option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you - although I must say it's a very nice package as is!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please keep in mind that this snapshot is not complete and is probably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buggy.  It should not be used for any critical work.  Feedback is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; New Features:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - Multiple TreeLine windows with different files . . .
</I>&gt;<i> Nice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - A &quot;Window&quot; menu has been added . . .
</I>&gt;<i> Of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     same document. This can be used to work in different sections of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the non-active window
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     does not show the changes made in the active window until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     non-active window is focused.
</I>&gt;<i> Can the &quot;not show changes&quot; behavior be an option?
</I>
I had planned to do a real-time update, but the performance was really
terrible, even with relatively small files.  The problem is that
TreeLine wasn't written for multiple windows, and it lacks fine-grained
control of what actually needs to be updated in the second window.  It
makes typing in an edit box so slow as to be really annoying.

I do plan to fix this eventually, but it will be part of a much larger
rewrite of the code in a future development cycle.

&gt;<i> Or offer a &quot;re-calc&quot; keystroke (like spread sheets)?
</I>
I thought about that, but controlling it by focus seemed to be more
natural.  So the the recalc command becomes either a click with the
mouse or something like an alt-tab keystroke.  I could add a separate
&quot;update duplicate windows&quot; command if users still want it after trying
the focus change approach.

&gt;<i> I can think of situations where seeing &quot;data output&quot; and &quot;data editor&quot; views
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time could be pretty handy when making simple text changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some and/or all advanced references (in the &quot;{**field_name*}&quot; syntax family)
</I>&gt;<i> could be ignored for these situations until either the non-active window is
</I>&gt;<i> focused, or the &quot;re-calc&quot; keystroke is entered.
</I>
The biggest problem seems to be the tree view, not the advanced
references.

&gt;<i> &gt;   - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     specified by file association or in the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> Can this behavior be an option as well?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I run multiple copies of several programs, for example, Firefox. Right now I
</I>&gt;<i> have a FF window with news and stock portfolios, another on RV searches
</I>&gt;<i> (doing homework for an ebay auction), and a third on hosting providers
</I>&gt;<i> (changing providers soon I hope).  I often have three or four Tree Line
</I>&gt;<i> files open for the same reason, and sometimes have the same file open more
</I>&gt;<i> than once (yes, I know the risk) to eliminate &quot;tennis match neck&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the &quot;good old days&quot; I'd have quite a few copies of simple text editors
</I>&gt;<i> and such running at the same time, each working with it's own file. Any
</I>&gt;<i> single mis-behaving program (or process) could be terminated with zero
</I>&gt;<i> impact on the others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some apps (like FF) try to fake this (much like you propose) but only have
</I>&gt;<i> one executable. I can appreciate this because of cache issues and so forth,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see the need with Tree Line. FF can get &quot;stuck&quot; from time to
</I>&gt;<i> time, and sometimes closing one window will work. Sometimes it doesn't :)
</I>
I'd be more worried about this if TreeLine crashed as often as most web
browsers.  TreeLine is simpler than web browsers, and, in my experience,
hard crashes are nearly non-existent if problems at initial startup are
excluded.

I'm reluctant to add an option that allows multiple executables again,
since it would mean that one window wouldn't know what files another had
open.  Since there is no file locking mechanism (cross-platform locking
methods are more of a pain than they're worth), it doesn't stop one
session from overwriting another.  I've had that happen when I have
multiple TreeLine sessions in different workspaces.

&gt;<i> Old habits die hard :) And I really hate &quot;single window&quot; programs like
</I>&gt;<i> Quicken that actively prevent multiple views into the same data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - An &quot;Add internal link&quot; context menu has been added . . .
</I>&gt;<i> That could be handy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - Added an &quot;HTML directory pages&quot; export option. This . . .
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting. Not sure how I'd use it, but . . .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Updates:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - The general options dialog has been split into three columns for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     better viewing on small, wide displays.
</I>&gt;<i> Great. Treeline is a bear on a little Linux netbook :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for testing!
</I>&gt;<i> Can't promise I will, but thanks for your continued interest!
</I>
Well, thanks for the feedback, anyway.

Doug
