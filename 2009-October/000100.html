+++++ Dual views of same file
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     same document. This can be used to work in different sections of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the non-active window
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     does not show the changes made in the active window until the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     non-active window is focused.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can the &quot;not show changes&quot; behavior be an option?
</I>  { skip }
&gt;&gt;<i> I can think of situations where seeing &quot;data output&quot; and &quot;data editor&quot; views
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the same time could be pretty handy when making simple text changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some and/or all advanced references (in the &quot;{**field_name*}&quot; syntax family)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be ignored for these situations until either the non-active window is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focused, or the &quot;re-calc&quot; keystroke is entered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest problem seems to be the tree view, not the advanced
</I>&gt;<i> references.
</I>
Understood. Could the non-active window only show changes in (it's) current
(on-screen) node (the text part perhaps)?

+++++ Multiple processes
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     specified by file association or in the command line.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can this behavior be an option as well?
</I>  { skip }
&gt;&gt;<i> In the &quot;good old days&quot; I'd have quite a few copies of simple text editors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and such running at the same time, each working with it's own file. Any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single mis-behaving program (or process) could be terminated with zero
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impact on the others.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some apps (like FF) try to fake this (much like you propose) but only have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one executable. I can appreciate this because of cache issues and so forth,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I don't see the need with Tree Line. FF can get &quot;stuck&quot; from time to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, and sometimes closing one window will work. Sometimes it doesn't :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be more worried about this if TreeLine crashed as often as most web
</I>&gt;<i> browsers.  TreeLine is simpler than web browsers, and, in my experience,
</I>&gt;<i> hard crashes are nearly non-existent if problems at initial startup are
</I>&gt;<i> excluded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm reluctant to add an option that allows multiple executables again,
</I>&gt;<i> since it would mean that one window wouldn't know what files another had
</I>&gt;<i> open.  Since there is no file locking mechanism (cross-platform locking
</I>&gt;<i> methods are more of a pain than they're worth), it doesn't stop one
</I>&gt;<i> session from overwriting another.  I've had that happen when I have
</I>&gt;<i> multiple TreeLine sessions in different workspaces.
</I>
Understood, and awareness within a process is a good thing (tm). Consider
this scenario of opened and modified (TreeLine) files:
 *) c:\file1.trl
 *) c:\file1.trl (a second window)
 *) l:\file2.trl (on another computer)

Crash the remote computer. What happens? Obviously L: changes are lost. But
did the process survive? (Have we lost all changes to C: file as well?)

+++++ Didn't sound right :(
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for testing!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can't promise I will, but thanks for your continued interest!
</I>&gt;<i> Well, thanks for the feedback, anyway.
</I>
Sorry - I was referring to my crowded calendar, and didn't mean to sound
like my nose was in a knot :) I'll take it out for a walk if I can, but I'm
not sure I can do meaningful (helpful) testing.

Again, thanks for a very nice package.
