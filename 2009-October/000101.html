</I>&gt;<i> +++++ Dual views of same file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;   - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     same document. This can be used to work in different sections of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     file simultaneously. For performance reasons, the non-active window
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     does not show the changes made in the active window until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     non-active window is focused.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can the &quot;not show changes&quot; behavior be an option?
</I>&gt;<i>   { skip }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I can think of situations where seeing &quot;data output&quot; and &quot;data editor&quot; views
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; at the same time could be pretty handy when making simple text changes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Some and/or all advanced references (in the &quot;{**field_name*}&quot; syntax family)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; could be ignored for these situations until either the non-active window is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; focused, or the &quot;re-calc&quot; keystroke is entered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The biggest problem seems to be the tree view, not the advanced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; references.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Understood. Could the non-active window only show changes in (it's) current
</I>&gt;<i> (on-screen) node (the text part perhaps)?
</I>
Maybe, I'd have to try it to check how responsive it is.  And a partial
update might tend to confuse users more than no update...

&gt;<i> +++++ Multiple processes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;   - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     line) will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     running. A new window will be opened if an unopened file was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;     specified by file association or in the command line.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can this behavior be an option as well?
</I>&gt;<i>   { skip }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In the &quot;good old days&quot; I'd have quite a few copies of simple text editors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and such running at the same time, each working with it's own file. Any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; single mis-behaving program (or process) could be terminated with zero
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; impact on the others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Some apps (like FF) try to fake this (much like you propose) but only have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one executable. I can appreciate this because of cache issues and so forth,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but I don't see the need with Tree Line. FF can get &quot;stuck&quot; from time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; time, and sometimes closing one window will work. Sometimes it doesn't :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd be more worried about this if TreeLine crashed as often as most web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browsers.  TreeLine is simpler than web browsers, and, in my experience,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard crashes are nearly non-existent if problems at initial startup are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; excluded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm reluctant to add an option that allows multiple executables again,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since it would mean that one window wouldn't know what files another had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open.  Since there is no file locking mechanism (cross-platform locking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods are more of a pain than they're worth), it doesn't stop one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session from overwriting another.  I've had that happen when I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple TreeLine sessions in different workspaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Understood, and awareness within a process is a good thing (tm). Consider
</I>&gt;<i> this scenario of opened and modified (TreeLine) files:
</I>&gt;<i>  *) c:\file1.trl
</I>&gt;<i>  *) c:\file1.trl (a second window)
</I>&gt;<i>  *) l:\file2.trl (on another computer)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Crash the remote computer. What happens? Obviously L: changes are lost. But
</I>&gt;<i> did the process survive? (Have we lost all changes to C: file as well?)
</I>
I don't think it matters where the file was stored.  TreeLine will give
an error if you try to save the file to a crashed remote drive, but
TreeLine won't crash.  I also don't think TreeLine would crash if the
drive containing TreeLine's excutable crashed, since it is already in
memory, but I haven't actually tested that.

I can't think of many scenarios where one combined session would lose
more work than separate sessions.

&gt;<i> +++++ Didn't sound right :(
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for testing!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Can't promise I will, but thanks for your continued interest!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, thanks for the feedback, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry - I was referring to my crowded calendar, and didn't mean to sound
</I>&gt;<i> like my nose was in a knot :)
</I>
That's OK - I didn't take it wrongly.

&gt;<i> I'll take it out for a walk if I can, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure I can do meaningful (helpful) testing.
</I>
OK.
