<PRE>I have a weird problem.

I have been using treeline for a few years. Both on Windows as well as
on Linux. On Linux I am not sure about which distros since they differ
depending on the machine I happen to work at, but they have been Debian,
Ubuntu 7, 8 and 9, OpenSUSE 10 and 11 and SLED/SLES 10 and 11 (Novell's
versions of OpenSUSE).

I upgraded to SLED 11 on my laptop in July. On top of that I run a
number of OpenSUSE 11.1 apps, this includes Treeline. (However version
1.3.0 was downloaded from the main download site.)

My problem now, which I discovered only recently, is that Treeline
crashes when I try to save a file, both plain save and save as. It also
crashes when I try to open a file from the Treeline File menu. But it
works fine to invoke Treeline with a file name.

I have tried with different versions, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.3.0. I
have updated Python to the latest available packages on opensuse.org.
But I get the same problem. I have googled trying to find similar
problems resolved by others, but to no avail.

I don't know Python so I don't know how to troubleshoot anything Python
related.

I have attached the last few screens of the log from when I start
treeline with strace. Maybe there is something to give a clue in there
to why it dies. This is when I try to use &quot;Save as&quot; immediately after
Treeline has started.

What else can I do?

Best regards,
