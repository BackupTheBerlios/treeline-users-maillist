This is the only case of this problem that I've heard about.  It must
be a problem with your libraries.  Please let me know what versions
you're running of Python, Qt, PyQt and sip.

&gt;<i> I don't know Python so I don't know how to troubleshoot anything Python
</I>&gt;<i> related.

I assume that you aren't seeing a Python traceback error message in a
terminal where TreeLine was started.  That is further evidence that the
problem is probably not in Python, but in another library.

&gt;<i> I have attached the last few screens of the log from when I start
</I>&gt;<i> treeline with strace. Maybe there is something to give a clue in there
</I>&gt;<i> to why it dies. This is when I try to use &quot;Save as&quot; immediately after
</I>&gt;<i> Treeline has started.
</I>
I didn't see an attachment, but i doubt it would help me in any case.
Hopefully letting me know the versions noted above will shed some light.
