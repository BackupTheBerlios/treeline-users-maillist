<PRE>Hi,

if you don't need the latest, the original treeline for SLED 11 can be found 
on the SLE 11 SDK:

<A HREF="http://download.novell.com/protected/Summary.jsp?buildid=fQKpDcAhPVY">http://download.novell.com/protected/Summary.jsp?buildid=fQKpDcAhPVY</A>

If you want something newer,

<A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/editors/SLE_11/noarch/treeline-1.2.3-6.1.noarch.rpm">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/editors/SLE_11/noarch/treeline-1.2.3-6.1.noarch.rpm</A>

is the latest package in the openSUSE build service that is supposed to work 
on SLED 11 (with the Python and PyQt packages provided by SLED 11, not the 
openSUSE 11.1 ones).

If this doesn't work, feel free to send me a bug report directly 
(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/treeline-users">joe at suse.de</A>). I'm trying to maintain the SLES and openSUSE packages in my 
free time.

There shouldn't be any practical difference between the treeline from 
<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html</A> and my packages, because it's all 
Python and isn't even compiled specifically for SLED 11. So I guess Doug is 
right that this must be a compatibility issue with a library, most likely 
between PyQt and Qt. Are you running treeline on a KDE or Gnome desktop?

BTW, in case the question comes up: I haven't updated to 1.2.4 because those 
changes seemed minor, and I haven't found the time yet to build 1.3.0 
packages (which are labeled &quot;unstable&quot; anyway).

Cheers

Joachim

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried with different versions, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.3.0. I

</I>&gt;<i> I have attached the last few screens of the log from when I start
