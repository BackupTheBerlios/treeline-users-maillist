<PRE>Hi,

I've just released a new development release - 1.3.1.  This release adds
an update alternate window command, allows the status bar to be hidden,
and makes it easier to restore default toolbars and keyboard shortcuts.
It also improves portability and batch commands on Windows and further
improves the plugin interface.

Please keep in mind that this snapshot is not complete and could be
buggy.  It should not be used for critical work.  Feedback is
apprecisted.

It can be downloaded from
&lt;<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable</A>&gt;.

I hope to keep this development cycle much shorter than the last one.  I
don't plan to include additional major changes until the next cycle.

More details are in the changelog:

Notes:
  - This is an unstable development snapshot. It may contain bugs.
    Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but the stable release
    (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical work.
  - The documentation has not yet been updated to cover the new
    features.
  - The GUI and documentation translations have not yet been updated.

New Features:
  - Added a menu command that updates another window containing the same
    file (without waiting for a focus change). This command also has a
    keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+W).
  - A menu option has been added to hide the status bar. There is also a
    new general option to hide it at startup. A hidden status bar is
    automatically shown temporarily for important messages.
  - A new button on the toolbar editing dialog will restore the default
    toolbar configuration.
  - A new button on the keyboard shortcuts editing dialog will restore
    the default shortcut configuration.

Updates:
  - Portability on Windows has been improved. A &quot;treeline.ini&quot; config
    file in TreeLine's &quot;lib&quot; directory will be used if it's present and
    there are no config files in the user's application data directory.
  - The Change Selected Data command has been updated to use Data Editor
    formats for dates and times.
  - An alternate TreeLine executable file (treeline_dos.exe) has been
    added to make batch command-line operations work from Windows.
  - Additional plugin methods have been added for handling files and
    languages.

Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed a problem spell checking with older versions of aspell when
    Unicode characters were present.
