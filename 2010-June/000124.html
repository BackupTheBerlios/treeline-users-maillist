<PRE>Hi,

I've just released a new development release - 1.3.3.  This release adds
a search function to the help viewer and lets keyboard shortcuts cycle
through data editor pages.  Also, the German translation was updated and
some minor bugs were fixed.  See the full change log below for details.

Please keep in mind that this snapshot could be buggy.  It should not be
used for critical work.  Feedback is apprecisted.

It can be downloaded from
&lt;<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html#unstable</A>&gt;.

I hope to keep this development cycle much shorter than the last one.  I
don't plan to include additional major changes until the next cycle.

More details are in the changelog:

Notes:

  - This is an unstable development snapshot. It may contain bugs.
    Testing and bug reports are appreciated, but the stable release
    (TreeLine 1.2.x) should be used for critical work.  German is the
    only GUI and documentation translation that has been updated so far.

New Features:

  - A new text search function has been added to the help viewer. 

  - The keyboard shortcuts for scrolling the right-hand views (Ctrl+Page
    Up and Ctrl+Page Down) now cycle through the Data Editor view pages
    if there is no more room to scroll

Updates:

  - The Linux system requirements have been updated to indicate that Qt
    4.4 or higher is now required.

  - The Windows installer now sets the sample and readme documents to
    read-only status.

  - The German GUI and documentation translation has been updated.

Bug Fixes:

  - The cascading of new windows has been fixed. It now references the
    current position of the previous window, and it avoids cascading
    windows off of the screen.

  - The Data Editor widgets are now sized correctly when TreeLine is
    started in Data Editor mode.

  - The spell checker and the Linux installation script have been
    updated to avoid subprocess command depreciation warnings.
