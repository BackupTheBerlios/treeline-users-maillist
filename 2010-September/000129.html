<PRE>Hi Doug -

Me again :)

Windows XP Pro SP 3, Tree Line 1.2.3, no local modifications.

As I've said before, thanks for a very nifty organizer - I owe you at least
a cup of coffee for your generosity.

I was starting a new home project today, and wanted to make a check-off
list. I maintain a library of software packages we use at home, and store
the distribution files in sub-directories. For example, a directory tree
might be:
  e:\Software Distributions
  e:\Software Distributions\Sumatra PDF Reader
  e:\Software Distributions\Thunderbird
  e:\Software Distributions\Torpark 1.5.0.7
  e:\Software Distributions\Treeline
  e:\Software Distributions\U3 Software
  e:\Software Distributions\UltraEdit

What I wanted to do was create a &quot;nest&quot; of similar items in TreeLine, one
per package, where I could make notes, delete-when-done the items, etc.
Nothing fancy. I need to check and update the packages where necessary, note
the current support web sites, track purchase and license data, and other
information.

Left tree nodes might look like this in Treeline:
  Update software
    Sumatra PDF Reader
    Thunderbird
    Torpark 1.5.0.7
    Treeline
    U3 Software
    UltraEdit

So what I needed to do was:
  {enter to insert new sibling after}
  {type in name of package}
  {enter to complete entry}
    etc.

Being lazy, I thought: how about I paste the output of a DIR (like an &quot;ls&quot;)
command into TreeLine? So I tried it and - nothing happened. Nothing.

In my case I was able to use an editor and make manual insertions into the
TRL file. No big deal, but it got me to thinking: it might be nice to do
some list processing in TreeLine - something where perhaps a spreadsheet or
database could be used as a source of data for a set of nodes.

I know there is an import capability in TreeLine, but that opens and creates
a new file, and what I wanted to do was a bit more elaborate: I wanted to
create new nodes in an existing file with the first field value for each
node defined.

So my suggestion: how about a new command (perhaps Data / Import list) that
imports (from the clipboard only) sets of values. Values are EOL terminated,
but embedded TAB characters are honored (more in a sec). Beginning with the
current node, replace fields with the clipboard values, skipping
un-referenced and/or incompatible fields in a node. Clipboard fields would
be delimited by TABs, and an EOL completes the current record. A succeeding
clipboard entry, if any, would create a new (empty) node with default values
per their respective &quot;default values for new nodes&quot; for each field, then
update the node as described above.

For example, say a data type (SAMPLE) contains the fields: Name (text), Size
(number), Date (date), Price (number). The clipboard contains three lines:
Can &lt;tab&gt; 12 &lt;tab&gt; 1/1/2001 &lt;eol&gt;
Bottle &lt;tab&gt; 32 &lt;tab&gt; 6/7/2003 &lt;eol&gt;
Case &lt;tab&gt; 144 &lt;tab&gt; 5/5/2010 &lt;eol&gt;

The cursor is on a node of type SAMPLE, which is followed by a node of type
CUSTOMER, and the &quot;Data&quot; / &quot;Import List&quot; function is invoked. The &quot;current&quot;
node's values for name, size and date would be replaced, and price would not
be changed. Since there are two more entries on the clipboard, two more
SAMPLE nodes would be created (with default values) and clipboard contents
processed as above. The result would be 3 SAMPLE nodes followed by a
CUSTOMER node.

If the cursor is not on a SAMPLE node - well, that's what &quot;Save First&quot; (or
undo) is for :)

An alternative to the &lt;tab&gt; delimiters might be a robust version of CSV
files (Comma Separated Values) - something that can cope with embedded
quotes (like Excel does).

I suggest the command only process the clipboard to completely distinguish
it from the File / Open type of test file import.

As an option (perhaps just for the current import, perhaps as an option in
the &quot;Tools / General Options&quot; or &quot;Tools / File Options&quot; dialog box), new
nodes would not be created so long as when the focus moves to the next node,
the same TYPE node is encountered (SAMPLE in this case). When a different
node type (CUSTOMER) is encountered, insertion of new (SAMPLE) type nodes
begins. This would permit &quot;updating&quot; an existing list. Perhaps the option is
labeled as &quot;Import List updates first: Y/N&quot; or something similar.

In that case, the clipboard values below would update the three SAMPLE
entries from above (current node is &quot;can&quot;) and create a new SAMPLE node
(because the fourth node in the TreeLine file is a type CUSTOMER node):
&lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; .95 &lt;eol&gt;
&lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; 1.49 &lt;eol&gt;
&lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt; 5.49 &lt;eol&gt;
box &lt;tab&gt; 72 &lt;tab&gt; 9/9/2010 &lt;tab&gt; 2.98 &lt;eol&gt;

The result would be 4 SAMPLE nodes followed by a CUSTOMER node.

Okay, I'm going to run hide in the shadows now, flame suit on :) Again,
thanks for a very useful program.
