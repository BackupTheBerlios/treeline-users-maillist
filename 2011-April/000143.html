Unfortunately not.  The structure of the undo system makes it very
difficult to reset the number in the general case.

When I coded the Unique ID feature, I emphasized uniqueness (for use as
an ID) rather than guaranteeing that it is sequential.  It also makes no
attempt to reset the counter if a node is deleted.

A work-around is to manually change the field format string after an
undo that removes a node.  That's where TreeLine is storing the next ID
in the sequence.

The next development series, which is a full rewrite that I'm working on
very slowly, will have a more sophisticated node ID system that
shouldn't suffer from the same problem.
