<PRE>Hi,

The 1.3.x development series is finally released as stable (1.4.0).
There are only minor changes since 1.3.5.  The biggest changes since
1.2.x are the multiple window functionality and easier internal link
creation.  See the full change log below for details.

It can be downloaded from
&lt;<A HREF="http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html">http://treeline.bellz.org/download.html</A>&gt;

More details are in the changelog:

Notes:
 - This is a new stable release, ending the 1.3.x development series.
 - This release is available in English, French and German, although the
   French documentation is not completely up to date. Volunteers to do
   additional translations are welcome.

Updates:
 - The file browser used for editing path-based fields now remembers the
   previously used directory.
 - Added icons for the New Window and Close Window commands so they can
   be added to toolbars.

Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug that could keep the column control from being enabled
   during HTML export.

Major New Features Since 1.2.x:
 - Different files can be open in multiple TreeLine windows within the
   same TreeLine session. This is controlled with commands in the new
   &quot;Window&quot; menu.
 - The &quot;Window-&gt;New Window&quot; command creates a new window with views of
   the same TreeLine file. Changes in either window are saved in the
   same document.
 - Starting TreeLine (from a shortcut, file association or command line)
   will activate an existing TreeLine session if it is already running.
 - An &quot;Add internal link&quot; context menu has been added to text boxes in
   the data editor. It prompts for another node to be clicked with the
   mouse, then an inline internal link is added with that node's
   reference information.
 - Added an &quot;HTML directory pages&quot; export option. This will export a
   directory structure with an HTML file for every node. A navigation
   pane on the left side of each page contains links to nearby nodes.
 - New dialog buttons will restore the default configuration when
   customizing toolbars or shortcuts.
 - A new text search function has been added to the help viewer.


-Doug
