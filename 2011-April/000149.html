<PRE>Hi,

As I've mentioned before, I'm slowly working on a full rewrite of
TreeLine.  Hopefully, it will improve some structural limitations of the
current version.

This rewrite is very incomplete, not yet ready for regular use.  But I'm
making the source code available for some users to try it to see where
it's headed.  Trying this isn't for the faint of heart, since it is not
neatly packaged (no installers or binaries) and requires some fairly
recent libraries.

If I haven't dissuaded you, go to &lt;<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</A>&gt; and search
for &quot;treeline&quot;.  From there, you can either use Mercurial to pull the
source code or download an archive.

The libraries needed to run this are more recent than the regular
version of TreeLine.  You'll need Python 3.2, Qt 4.6 or greater, and
PyQt 4.8 or greater.  On Linux, you might have to build PyQt yourself,
since many distros don't package it for Python 3.2 yet.  On Windows,
you'll need to do binary installs of Python and PyQt (which will
include Qt).

There are several structural changes that should make TreeLine run
faster.  It uses Qt's model-view classes for the tree and uses
ElementTree to parse the XML in stored files.  I've dropped the
separation that excluded Qt from the core code (it doesn't make sense
with model-view).  It uses a table-based Data Edit view, which is much
faster and eliminates the need for the view to be paged.  Multiple views
of the same file will update real-time.

The TreeLine rewrite does not maintain full compatibility with the files
from TreeLine 1.2.x or 1.4.x.  The basic structure is the same, so most
data should be preserved, but there are some differences in
formatting.  These differences will be most apparent on files with
more complex formatting.

The basic text field type is now a hybrid of the plain text field and
the HTML field.  It preserves line breaks and allows HTML's restricted
characters.  But it also allows formatting (bold, underline and italics
so far) and internal and external links.

The data edit view widgets are WYSIWYG for the new text fields.  There
are also new entry widgets for dates and internal or external links.

Each node now has a built-in unique ID that is generated from the
contents of a reference field, with added suffixes if necessary to keep
it unique.  It's updated as that field changes, and any internal links
that point to it are automatically updated.

The many features that are still missing include all file imports, all
file exports, printing, searching, filtering, sorting, numbering,
advanced formatting, some field types, customization, the plugin
interface, etc.  Yes, I still have some work to do.

If you do try this out, I'd appreciate hearing your feedback and
suggestions.

-Doug
