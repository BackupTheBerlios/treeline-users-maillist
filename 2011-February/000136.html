Thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - I would like to configure a field type as &quot;custom&quot; and select an
</I>&gt;<i> existing custom datatype in order to nest it in my item and avoid mixing
</I>&gt;<i> different data types among one node's childs. I expect that this would

</I>
It would be a recursive mess if you allow a custom field to be set to
another custom field.  Otherwise that shouldn't be a problem.

But I don't see the advantage of this approach.  Why not mix different
types of children?  You still have to set the actual field format, so
why not keep it simple and use the regular data type setting?

More detail on why you want this would be helpful.


&gt;<i> 2 - Another useful feature, always looking to field types, would be the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to define a field as &quot;repeatable&quot;: once the field has been
</I>&gt;<i> filled on the editor view, another instance of the field should be
</I>&gt;<i> created just below the filled one, in order to create a simple &quot;in-line&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> list that could be rendered in the output view as a table...
</I>
But how would the output distinguish between repeatable field n and
field n+1?  And the views wouldn't know how many fields to show until
they looked at the contents of each node.  This seems ugly to code.

I'd recommend using child nodes when you have a variable number of
sub-items to display.


&gt;<i> 3 - Finally I end up with a question: is it possible, and eventually
</I>&gt;<i> how, to write an output code for a data type in order to automatically
</I>&gt;<i> generate a clickable &quot;content summary&quot; for all childs of a node?
</I>
You can create a summary now, but not a clickable one.  In the Output
tab of the Configure Data Types dialog (with Advanced features shown),
select &quot;Child Reference&quot; under the &quot;Reference Level&quot; and the choose the
applicable child type under &quot;Reference Type&quot;.  Then just move the child
fields into the Output Format box.

Actually, it is possible to do a clickable list of children, but I can't
think of a way to get unique text in each link.  If you show the child
list as described above, but set the separator string (under Tools-&gt;File
Options) to something like this:
   &quot;&gt;child&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#
Of course, the text in the Output box would need to include partial tags
in order for the first and last items to work.  This will get you the
links, but unfortunately with the same text in each one.

If you tell me more about your application for this, I might have more
suggestions.
