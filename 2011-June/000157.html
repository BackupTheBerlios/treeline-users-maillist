<PRE>Hi Doug and Treeline-users,

I am a relatively new but very enthusiastic user of Treeline - and I must say that so far I am truly impressed. I honestly thank you Doug for the wonderful work you've done so far. Here are some feature suggestions for further improvement (and implicitly questions if there is a way round these that I haven't figured out yet) just in case you find them interesting.

a. An option for the right-click-menu in the editor view for adding multiple internal links from which you can exit by a right-click (...it just saves a few click here and there I know...so, you can dismiss it as a very-lazy-guy's whim!)

b. Allowing a Choice or Combination field to contain the (1st level only?) children of a specific node (it can save a lot of configuring existing and creating new data types).

c. Some form of command-line execution of the menu/toolbar options. I could think of various ways how such a feature could prove useful. For example, think of the situation of having different treeline files but you need to use the same data filter that contains 3-4 rules. Then, instead of re-entering the rules to each file, you could simply save the command as a plain text somewhere and copy and paste it to each file. (I have the impression it must be rather straightforward to implement this given that each item in the toolbars make a function call anyway). In fact, on this you can then built up a whole bunch of things for automation - e.g. some form of a field that contains only a sequence of such calls (I'm thinking now the good-old DOS batch files) which could be used for example for customising the appearance of each treeline file (by setting at loading time in a sequence the background colour and the text fonts).

So far I cannot think of anything else (hey, you've a hell-of-a-job here!) - but I'll let you know if I get any inspiration.

Many thanks once more for this great tool.

Take care

All the best
Mike
