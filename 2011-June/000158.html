</I>&gt;<i> for the wonderful work you've done so far. Here are some feature
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions for further improvement (and implicitly questions if there
</I>&gt;<i> is a way round these that I haven't figured out yet) just in case you
</I>&gt;<i> find them interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a. An option for the right-click-menu in the editor view for adding
</I>&gt;<i> multiple internal links from which you can exit by a right-click
</I>&gt;<i> (...it just saves a few click here and there I know...so, you can
</I>&gt;<i> dismiss it as a very-lazy-guy's whim!)
</I>
Sorry, but this seems rather complicated for a minor reduction in
clicks.

&gt;<i> b. Allowing a Choice or Combination field to contain the (1st level
</I>&gt;<i> only?) children of a specific node (it can save a lot of configuring
</I>&gt;<i> existing and creating new data types).
</I>
What would the field end up containing once you clicked on one of the
chilren in the pull-down?  Just a static copy of the child's title?
What is the use case for this?

&gt;<i> c. Some form of command-line execution of the menu/toolbar options. I
</I>&gt;<i> could think of various ways how such a feature could prove useful. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, think of the situation of having different treeline files but
</I>&gt;<i> you need to use the same data filter that contains 3-4 rules. Then,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of re-entering the rules to each file, you could simply save
</I>&gt;<i> the command as a plain text somewhere and copy and paste it to each
</I>&gt;<i> file. (I have the impression it must be rather straightforward to
</I>&gt;<i> implement this given that each item in the toolbars make a function
</I>&gt;<i> call anyway). In fact, on this you can then built up a whole bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> things for automation - e.g. some form of a field that contains only a
</I>&gt;<i> sequence of such calls (I'm thinking now the good-old DOS batch files)
</I>&gt;<i> which could be used for example for customising the appearance of each
</I>&gt;<i> treeline file (by setting at loading time in a sequence the background
</I>&gt;<i> colour and the text fonts).
</I>
I've been thinking of something like this for the full rewrite of
TreeLine.  It's sort of a cross between the current version's plugins
and a macro language.  I'm not anywhere close to implementing it yet,
though.

Unfortunately, I've been too busy with other stuff (both work and
personal) to spend much time on the rewrite.  Hopefully that will
eventually change, but I don't know when.

&gt;<i> So far I cannot think of anything else (hey, you've a hell-of-a-job
</I>&gt;<i> here!) - but I'll let you know if I get any inspiration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks once more for this great tool.
</I>
You're welcome!
