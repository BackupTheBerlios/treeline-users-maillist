</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;for the diabetics use aspartame&quot;; or you've got an exotic
</I>&gt;<i> ingredient's name and you want to include a picture to describe it)?
</I>&gt;<i> If you could use the children of a node as the entries of the

</I>&gt;<i> in the node and one in the combination field). But once the items get
</I>&gt;<i> beyond 20-30 then this would become quite cumbersome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine now what would happen if you had decided that the incredients
</I>&gt;<i> were too many for one list and it would be best if you spit them into
</I>&gt;<i> two groups -say one for the standard and one for the exotic
</I>&gt;<i> ingredients. Right now, you would have to add an extra Combination
</I>&gt;<i> field to the recipes data-type and manually spit the entries of each
</I>&gt;<i> list. If you could construct a Combination field out of the children
</I>&gt;<i> of a node then the whole endeavour would be simply to a. divide the
</I>&gt;<i> ingredients into two subgroups with the easiness that the drag-n-drop
</I>&gt;<i> feature of Treeline allows, b. add an extra Combination field to the
</I>&gt;<i> recipes data-type; and c. redirect the two Combination fields to point
</I>&gt;<i> to the correct (sub)list. For more than 2 groups the benefits from the
</I>&gt;<i> 2nd approach are inevitably combounded. So I hope I've managed to
</I>&gt;<i> exemplify why I felt that this feature would be useful.
</I>
I'm not sure that I'm following this.  Where are the ingredients in the
tree structure?  Are there ingredient nodes under each recipe node, with
just the ingredients that each recipe needs?  Or are all possible
ingredients somewhere else in the structure?

It's sometimes better to structure your data so that much of the info is
in child nodes rather than trying to combine it all into the fields of
one node type.

Also, do you know that lists of child fields can be shown as a comma
delimitted list in a node's output?  Hit the Show Advanced button on the
Output tab of the Configure Data Types dialog.  Then choose Child
Reference as the Reference Type and the appropriate child type as the
Reference Type.  Then you can add child fields to the parent node's
output.

&gt;<i> As for the 'sticky Add Internal Link' feature, I also think it is
</I>&gt;<i> rather simple (...I hope you won't beat me if you ever bump into me!).
</I>&gt;<i> In pseudocode, instead of having a call to the function
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;On_left_click_Copy_internal_link_to_textbox;&quot; put it in a while loop
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;While right_click=FALSE;
</I>&gt;<i> On_left_click_Copy_internal_link_to_textbox; Wend;&quot;). However, I could
</I>&gt;<i> be wrong because I cannot be sure as to how you've implemented the
</I>&gt;<i> whole thing (and when it comes to Python I am as ignorant as a man can
</I>&gt;<i> be).
</I>
When I said it was complex, I wasn't referring to how hard it would be
to code the feature.  I maent that how the feature works wouldn't be
obvious to a user.  If I included every suggestion I got for new
interface features, TreeLine would be a bloated mess that nobody would
want to use.
