<PRE>Hi Phillip,

Any chance you could upload somewhere (or send to me off-list) enough of an
excerpt of your Treeline file? I'd like to study it to see how I might adapt
it for my own needs.

Regards,
Todd

Thanks for the rapid comment, Doug. In fact after burning the midnight oil
yesterday I think that the answer to my 'wish' was in fact largely already
available from within Treeline, so I'll try and clarify what I'm on about in
case it's useful for someone else.

A Treeline Project: using Treeline you construct a 'home library' database
of books you own, books you have read from the local library or elsewhere,
and also say books you have been interested in from reviews and want to
follow up. The database can be sub-divided by topic; for example, - Science,
- Mathematics, -Non-fiction, -Fiction, -Science Fiction etc. Each topic
contains records for multiple books, with each record having multiple fields
such as Author, Title, Publisher, ISBN, Year, Read, Rating, Ebook, Tags,
Description etc.

So far so good. Similar to the sample file 'basic_booklist'.

Then, you plan to hit the library or the local bookstore to browse and / or
look for new material to read. You need a printed output from the database
for guidance, but really only need a listing, by topic, of Author and Title
say, and not the full record for each book. For multiple reasons, to do this
in a small font size on something like A5 paper or (as I have been doing
previously) on filofax sized paper (aprox. 95mm * 170mm) is obviously much
more practical. A similar thought process would apply to, for instance, a
database of classical, pop and other music CD's held.

Solution: Treeline allows an A5 paper size selection for printed output: -
File | Print Options | Page Setup tab, paper size options. *** any chance of
a 'custom' paper size option in the future? This area also allows font and
size selection, header/footer options etc. Superb!!! &gt;From within your
database via Data | Sort Nodes there is an ability to alpha-sort Author by
last-name, then Book by title, for example &gt;From within your database via
Data | Configure Data Types | Output tab you can flexibly configure the
printed output using the Field List and Output Format sections.

Result: an annotated A5 listing of Author and associated books,
alpha-sorted. Filtering not required.

Astonishing that so many software databases seem to neglect the flexibility
to do this sort of thing for the printed output, as opposed to the program
screen output.

So, I am blushing that I didn't persist and sort this myself before posting,
but am delighted to have found and begun to utilise Treeline after multiple
previous false starts trying to do this. Again, many thanks Doug for making
this available and continuing to develop it, I suspect it will become a
much-used part of my personal management.

Regards, Phillip Hughes
