<PRE>Wolfgang,

Sorry about my delay in replying - I've been pretty busy lately.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TreeLine is based on the Qt library, so you probably changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the system defaults in a Qt4 Settings application or something

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, probably, but I cannot find these settings in Linux Mint Debian
</I>&gt;<i> 64 rolling distribution.
</I>
Try looking for a package called qt4-config or something similar.


&gt;<i> &gt;If you just want to fix TreeLine...
</I>&gt;<i> Better than nothing :-) Actually I don't mind other software too
</I>&gt;<i> much, but Treeline should be fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;... uncheck the Tools&gt;  Use Default System Colors menu item
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and set colors you like using Tools&gt;  Background Color
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and Tools&gt;  Text Color.
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see in the screenshot: The color font of the buttons is
</I>&gt;<i> still white. I can set the other colors to black so that I can read
</I>&gt;<i> the content.
</I>
OK, so this problem is beyond the color adjustment that Treeline can do.
Hopefully the qt4-config package can help.


&gt;<i> By the way 1: Is there any plan to export to e.g. MediaWiki?
</I>
No current plans.  I've been trying to find time to get back to working
on the TreeLine rewrite, so I don't have time for new export filters.
It could be written as a plugin if somebody wants to tackle it.


&gt;<i> By the way 2: Can you make use of my set of data types? I have
</I>&gt;<i> created many data types...
</I>
I probably should create some kind of wiki page where users can
contribute things like that.  But I don't knowwhen I'll get to it...

-Doug
